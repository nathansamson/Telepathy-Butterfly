telepathy-butterfly-0.5.7 (????)
======================================

Enhancements:

 * GetInterfaces on the connection will now return before the
   connection status is CONNECTED which means Mission Control can see
   that we have the (simple)presence interface and set an initial
   presence that we should use once we become actually connected. This
   stops the annoying transition of always connected as invisible and
   then quickly changing to the value in RequestedPresence.

Fixes:

 * fd.o#24699: Stop abusing (Message_Type_Action, "nudge") to send
   nudges.

Dependencies:

telepathy-butterfly-0.5.6 (2010-03-12)
======================================

This release is the first release where the previous mess of 1-1
channels actually being unnamed MUCs is fixed! The conference channel
interface introduces a method to represent a channel as a continuation
of one or more than one other channel.

As a result of this work, proper MUC support now works. Users can now
invite other contacts, and be invited, to chatrooms.

Enhancements:

 * Implemented conference channel interface. Doing so also split up
   ButterflyTextChannel into a base text channel class, with the same
   name, and three subclasses. See the git logs for more
   information.

 * Copy the official client with respect to typing notifications.

Fixes:

 * Use escape_as_identifier in the channel manager so when we create
   group channels with characters that aren't safe for object paths,
   they are actually escaped.

Dependencies:

 * telepathy-python 0.15.17
